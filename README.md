## Getting Started

1. Start backend Cynosura.Studio.Web (`dotnet run`)
2. Start frontend Cynosura.Studio.Web.Ng (`npm run start`)
3. Open Cynosura.Studio at http://localhost:4300/
4. Create new solution in Solutions section and your new project is ready
5. Add your entity in Entities section

### Prerequisites

* .NET Core SDK 3.1
* Git (used for merging files when updating metadata or upgrading templates)

### Metadata

Cynosura.Studio allows you to create entities and enums in web UI. Entities and enums created in UI will be generated into code in your project: models, CQRS classes, EF configurations, API models and controllers, Angular models, services, and components, etc. You can change generated code as you like. When later you wish to update entity or enum metadata, those changes will be merged into your code without overwriting your custom changes.

### Solution upgrade

Upgrade feature lets you upgrade your solution to the latest template version. When you upgrade your project to newer template version, template changes will be merged to your project without overwriting your changes. Sometimes merge conflict might occur.

### Templates

Cynosura.Studio creates projects from default template [Cynosura.Template](https://github.com/CynosuraPlatform/Cynosura.Template). However you can use custom templates. 

If you want to create your own template then start by forking Cynosura.Template. Your template must be published in some nuget feed to use in Cynosura.Studio. To use custom template configure it in appsettings.json in Templates section.

### NuGet Feeds

Cynosura.Studio supports private NuGet feeds in appsettings with keys Nuget/FeedUrl, and Nuget/Username and Nuget/Password.

For Template development, you can set local folder feed LocalFeed/SourcePath.
